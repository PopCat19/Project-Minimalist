## About

#### What is Project Minimalist?
Project Minimalist is a minimalist osu! skin designed in Figma. It is also my first skin, originally created to tailor my needs in osu! I'll be sharing my skin and project files here for others to modify and distribute. I really hope you like my work so far!

#### What stuff is included in Project Minimalist?
Project Minimalist includes skin releases, project files, and other things that I might make. Project files are gonna be released as .fig project files since I use Figma to create the skin elements. I dunno how to use Adobe Photoshop, so I'm really sorry if you're looking for .psd project files!

#### Can I use the project files and share them with my friends?
Of course! Though credits would be very much appreciated.

#### I don't like a few things in the skin, how can I tell you things to improve?
You can ask me anything in Discord (popcat19) or submit a pull request with changes you want and I'll try my best to implement them!

#### How can I support this project?
You can support Project Minimalist by just trying it out and giving me advice and feedback! It's my hobby after all.

#### Where are the project files?
The project files are still being prepared for the upcoming major release. If you really want one right now, you can request one through my Discord!

#### How do I use the skin?
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/PopCat19/Project-Minimalist/releases).
2. Open the .osk file from your downloads folder.
4. In osu!, go to the Options menu.
5. Select any "Project Minimalist" skin from the skin list.
