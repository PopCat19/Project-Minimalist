#### What is Project Minimalist?
Project Minimalist is a minimalist focused osu! skin designed in Figma, a cloud-based web designing tool. It's also my first time designing a custom skin, originally made after being inspired by my friend's works and to tailor my personal needs in osu! â€• I'll be releasing the skin and project files here for others to explore and enjoy. I really hope you enjoy the work as much as I did in learning and designing. I'm still learning more about Figma and osu!, so check back occasionally for new releases!

#### What stuff are included in Project Minimalist?
Project Minimalist includes skin releases, project files, and other similar things that I may create later. There are currently NM, HD, and DT variants, aswell as instafade patches for NM and DT. The project files are also to be released as `.fig` filetype. Use Figma to import the project files to inspect and edit.

#### Can I modify and share this others?
Of course! Credits are optional but it would be very much appreciated.

#### How do I share some feedback?
You can ask me anything in Discord: `popcat19`. You may also submit an issue with changes you want and I'll try to implement them.

#### How can I support this project?
You can support Project Minimalist by just trying it out and giving me advice and feedback! After all, it's a fun project to work on.

#### Where are the project files?
The project files are slowly being released with couple of modifications to improve convenience. Check the [releases page](https://github.com/PopCat19/Project-Minimalist/releases) to find the latest project file. If you really want the latest one right now, you may request one through discord.
